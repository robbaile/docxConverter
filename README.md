# docxConverter
convert .docx to html

This small tool uses a package called mammoth to convert a word (.docx) to a html file. 

To start run npm install and create a folder called directory and another called output.

Next put all the word .docx files you want to convert into the directory folder and then on the command line run node index.js

You should then see the converted files in the output folder. To unminify them hold shift + alt + F.
